          We had an ambitious vision, but couldn’t have known then the extent to which that vision would become shared and leveraged by so much of the Internet.
          <br />
          <br />
          We wanted to take this moment to highlight the people and organizations that have helped make our impact possible, and share a bit about where we’re heading for the next ten years.

          Technology continues to evolve and change at a rapid clip and is becoming ever more enmeshed in our lives and those of our children, friends, colleagues, and loved ones. This trend isn&#39;t likely to change any time soon, from healthcare increasingly reliant on Internet connected medical devices, to education using more apps and online learning tools, to the countless other sectors and areas of life all relying more and more on data and technology. For all of these uses, security and
          privacy can&#39;t be forgotten or ignored. As we look toward the next decade of ISRG (and beyond!), we commit to continuing our mission to reduce the financial, technological, and educational barrier to secure communications over the Internet, in whatever form that might take.
