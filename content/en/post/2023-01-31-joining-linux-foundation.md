We're pleased to announce that ISRG has joined The Linux Foundation as an Associate Member. For many years, The LF was an administrative home for ISRG, enabling us to focus our resources on the engineering work related to building Let's Encrypt. In 2023, we took our administrative needs in-house, and we are thrilled to evolve our relationship with the Linux Foundation by becoming a [Member](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/members).

Over the years, it has been apparent to us via our insider's view that The LF is truly a powerhouse for supporting Open Source. As our work at ISRG evolves, we look forward to continuing collaboration with The Linux Foundation and its projects - like supporting the growth of Rust in its namesake project via our [Prossimo](http://memorysafety.org) effort, and working with the OpenSSF team on the [Open Source Security Mobilization Plan's](https://openssf.org/oss-security-mobilization-plan/) memory safety workstream.

ISRG is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that is 100% supported through the generosity of those who share our vision for ubiquitous, open Internet security. If you'd like to support our work, please consider [getting involved](/getinvolved/), [donating](/donate/), or encouraging your company to [become a sponsor](/sponsor/).
