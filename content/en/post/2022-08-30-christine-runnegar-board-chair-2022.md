Christine Runnegar has recently assumed ISRG's Board Chair duties. Please join me in welcoming her to this new role.

As a member of the ISRG Board of Directors since [2018](https://www.abetterinternet.org/post/welcoming-christine-runnegar/), Christine has contributed meaningfully to our organization. She brings an international perspective to pressing issues related to security and privacy through a career that has spanned several continents, most recently at Internet Society. Her experience helps us respond to the needs of a global internet.

Christine deeply values the ISRG's committed public interest role of providing a trusted, reliable and sustainable home for public-benefit digital infrastructure projects such as [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), [Prossimo](https://www.memorysafety.org/), and [Divvi Up](https://divviup.org/). Throughout her career, she has pursued roles that have advanced the public interest, whether as a lawyer for the Australian government in competition and consumer protection or anti-spam litigation, or by promoting policy, legal or technical solutions that improve the privacy and security of individuals when they go online.

As Senior Director, Internet Trust at the Internet, Christine has contributed to the work of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Council of Europe, The African Union, APEC, and other stakeholders in developing better public policy for digital security and privacy, for the protection of Internet users. She serves on the International Association of Privacy Practitioners (IAPP) Privacy Engineering Section Advisory Board and as a chair the W3C Privacy Interest Group (PING), which reviews the privacy risks and features of web specifications. Christine has also served on the Permanent Stakeholders Group of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), providing strategic direction for the organization's work, and as an expert in the Stiftung Neue Verantwortung (SNV) Transatlantic Cyber Forum.

In addition, Christine's expertise in policy development has benefited ISRG. The Board has taken on the recent task of updating our bylaws, a job that Christine led. Her enthusiasm and diligence in this process helped us to bring more clarity to our governance.

It has been wonderful for me to get to know Christine over the last five years, and I look forward to working with her in this new role.
