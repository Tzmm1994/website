We're pleased to announce that ISRG has received a grant of $100,000 from Craig Newmark Philanthropies. This funding will help support various activities related to our projects and mission.

When we initially connected with Craig Newmark, the founder of craigslist and [Craig Newmark Philanthropies](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3062682-1%26h%3D663540785%26u%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fcraignewmarkphilanthropies.org%252F%26a%3DCraigNewmarkPhilanthropies.org&esheet=52683819&newsitemid=20220412005748&lan=en-US&anchor=CraigNewmarkPhilanthropies.org&index=13&md5=7670cbc79c80c6eb8ec1d94f11144756), we found common ground in the desire to improve Internet security. At ISRG, our three projects tackle security and privacy in order to make the Internet better for everyone, everywhere. One of our guiding beliefs is that the Internet is so complex that average users can't deeply understand the security implications of their choices. And yet, the Internet is so essential to thriving in today's world that it is imperative we make it better.

In 2022, Craig Newmark Philanthropies [pledged $50 million](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220412005748/en/Craig-Newmark-Philanthropies-Pledges-50-Million-to-Cyber-Civil-Defense) to help support a response to the Internet's growing complexity and the subsequent growth of opportunistic cybersecurity threats. We look forward to contributing to this effort. Our [Prossimo](https://www.memorysafety.org/) project, which focuses on improving memory safety in critical infrastructure, particularly struck a chord with Newmark. "I learned about memory safety bugs the hard way, back in 1985 when I was a programmer. We now have the tools to address this problem, so it's time to take action and eliminate these bugs and vulnerabilities by using memory safe code." We couldn't agree more and are glad to have the support of organizations like Craig Newmark Philanthropies to help us get there!
